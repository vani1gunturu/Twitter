# **PROJECT: TWITTER**

I have used three test cases in my program

1.followProfile() 

2.validate()

3.unfollowAndLogout()

**followProfile():**

In this, the first step I am doing is going to Twitter.com And click on Sign in.
Login to the application by giving the valid credentials
and then search for POTUS and click on POTUS. And
then I am following his profile

**validate():**

In this, I am cross verifying whether I am following the Profile or not by writing the ASSERT statement.

**unfollowAndLogout():**

Unfollow and LogOut.so that my program will run every time whenever we execute it.

**TestNG Framework:**

I have used TestNG, to get the report, how many test cases passed, how many failed and how many skipped.
Since TestNG will execute the test cases based on alphabetical order, I have given the priority to my Test Cases.
It will execute in the right process.
